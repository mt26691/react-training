## Why redux?
Single page application becomes more and more compicalted, our code must manage more state than ever before
We are, the developers, are expected to handle optimistic update, server-side rendering, fetching data
before performing route trainsitions.

 Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable

 ## Three fundamental principles of Redux.
 `Single source of truth:` The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

 `State is read-only:` The only way to change the state is to emit an action

 `Changes are made with pure functions`
